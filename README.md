# Terrain generator

Crappy noise-based terrain/heightmap generator I'm using for a roguelike. For now it just provides a decently configurablec
Simplex noise class and a class to write an array of floats to a coloured image.

When I have time, I should also explore here the integration of the heightmap with weather, humidity, temperature
and the biomes that they, together, generate.
